When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her total
outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin
satchel, a small lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse,
containing her ticket, a scrap of paper with her sister's address in
Van Buren Street, and four dollar in money. It was in August, 1889. She
was eighteen years or age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of
ignorance and youth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterized
her given up. A gush of tears at her mother's farewell kiss, mill where
her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the familiar green
environs of the village passed in  review and the threads which bound
her so lightly to  girlhood and home were irretrievably broken.
